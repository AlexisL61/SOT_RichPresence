# Sot Rich Presence

Sot Rich Presence is an open-source application designed to enhance your Discord experience by displaying rich presence information about your activity in the game Sea of Thieves. With this application, you can choose specific in-game activities and the type of ship you are using, which will then be shown on your Discord profile.

## Installation

To install Sot Rich Presence, follow these steps:

1. Download the appropriate version for your operating system from the [releases page](https://github.com/AlexisL61/SOT_RichPresence/releases):
   - For Linux: `SOT_RichPresence_Linux.zip`
   - For Windows: `SOT_RichPresence_Windows.zip`
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Run the executable found inside the zip file.

## Features

- **Activity Selection:** Choose from a list of activities to display on your Discord profile.
- **Ship Selection:** Specify the type of ship you are using.
- **Automatic Updates:** The application fetches the latest activities at startup, so you don't need to update the app to get the newest activities.

## Important Note

⚠️ The application does not automatically detect your in-game activity by monitoring the game process. You need to manually select your activity and ship type within the application.
